# Storm.Pattern

This is the demo topology for Storm.pattern: [link](https://github.com/quintona/storm-pattern)

Please refer to that projects readme for details, but essentially build storm.pattern first then build this project using mvn clean install and run the topology in location mode.

The model and test data is embedded into the topology defition.
